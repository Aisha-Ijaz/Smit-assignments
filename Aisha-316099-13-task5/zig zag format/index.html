    <img src="assets/zebra.jpg" alt="Zebra" height="300" width="300" align="top"><p>Zebras are distinctively marked animals known for their black-and-white striped coats. Native to Africa, they are social creatures that live in herds and are closely related to horses and donkeys. Each zebra's stripe pattern is unique, functioning as a form of camouflage and a means of identification among the herd. Zebras are herbivores, feeding primarily on grass, and they play a crucial role in their ecosystem by grazing, which helps maintain the balance of vegetation. Their strong sense of community and ability to run at high speeds help them evade predators in the wild.</p>

    <p><img src="assets/giraffe.jpg" alt="Giraffe" height="350" width="300" align="right">Giraffes are the tallest land animals, easily recognized by their long necks and legs, along with their distinctive coat patterns of brown patches on a light background. Native to Africa, giraffes inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands where they feed primarily on leaves, especially from acacia trees. Their long necks allow them to reach vegetation that other herbivores cannot. Despite their height, giraffes have a graceful gait and can run at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour when threatened. They are social animals, often seen in loose groups, and play a key role in maintaining their ecosystems by pruning trees and dispersing seeds</p>

    The tiger is one of the most iconic and powerful animals in the world, known for its majestic appearance and strength. As the largest species in the cat family, tigers can weigh up to 600 pounds and are distinguished by their striking orange coat with black stripes. These solitary hunters are found primarily in Asia, living in a range of habitats such as tropical forests, grasslands, and swamps. Tigers are apex predators, meaning they sit at the top of the food chain, preying on animals like deer and wild boar. Unfortunately, tigers are also endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, with only around 3,900 left in the wild today. Conservation efforts are crucial to protecting these magnificent creatures and ensuring their survival for future generations.</p>
